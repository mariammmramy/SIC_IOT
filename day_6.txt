1-How does cron scheduling work? Show a crontab entry to run a script every 5 minutes. 
-cron is a time-based job scheduler in Linux.
It uses a crontab file where each line represents a scheduled job.

example:
*/5 * * * * /home/mariam/iot_logger/sensor.py >> /home/mariam/iot_logger/logs/sensor.log 2>&1


2-Why do we need log rotation? Show an example logrotate config for temperature.log. 
Logs grow indefinitely if not managed eventually filling disk space, so we compress older logs to save space or delete very old logs

3-Explain the difference between a Virtual Machine and a Container.Must containers use the same OS as the host? Why or why not?
Virtual Machine is a full computer system running on top of another computer

Container shares the host’s kernel and has an isolated environment for running applications.

Kernel must match in container since containers share the host’s kernel, they cannot run a different kernel type.

User space can be diffrent for example host can be running on ubuntu but container can be debian , they both have same kernel
 
4-Reflection: Which actions in this project combined multiple Linux concepts (e.g., redirection + process monitoring)? How does this apply to real IoT systems?

-Running the Python script in the background + verifying with ps or jobs. This combines process control with running in background (&) with process monitoring using ps.

-Redirecting script output into temperature.log + log rotation. Here you combined input ouput redirection > or >> for log management.
