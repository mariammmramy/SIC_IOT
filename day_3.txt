Files:
r : reading the file contents
w : modifying the file
x : running the file 

Directories:
r : allows listing the files in directory
w : allows creating or editing files
x : allows entering directory and accessing files inside

Example using ls-l:
-rwxr--r--  1 mariam users  1024 Sep  1  notes.sh
drwxr-x---  2 mariam users  4096 Sep  1  projects

Octal :
r = 4, w = 2, x = 1

and we add them to get number, and we also can list in order of owner, group , others
ex: 500 = 4+1 so r-x, 0 so ---, 0 so ---

Unmask:
It subtracts permissions from the system default
ex:
If umask = 022:
New file: 666 - 022 = 644 (rw-r--r--)
New directory: 777 - 022 = 755 (rwxr-xr-x)

Normal user has limited permissions and canâ€™t install packages and has limitations.

Root user is superuser and has full access to any files and can install any packages
Dangerous because: full control can destroy the system from minor mistakes
